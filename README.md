# Network-Scanner
A simple script to scan the devices connected with the same network written in python3 using scapy 

I know there are a lot of tools for network scanning but when i was trying **netdiscover** it wasn't working  for me so i thought how can i build a simple scanning tool .Moreover  sometimes it's fun using own scripts or  tools :3 

**usage :**
   ##### run : `sudo python3 network_scanner.py` 


**Under Development**
